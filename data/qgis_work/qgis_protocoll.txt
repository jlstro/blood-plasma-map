import us_counties_raw.geojson
change projection
import donor_centers_geocoded.csv
import economy_by_counties_clean.csv
join economy_by_counties_clean and us_counties_raw on county code fields
change us_counties_raw to 'graduated' with household income as data field (this is just for my overview)
count points in polygons to find out how many centers in each county, save to file
select donor_centers_geocoded by position to exclude all outside of us_counties_raw
create 50-mile-buffer for selected donor_centers_geocoded, save to file
calculate area of each county in us_counties_raw, save to column
calculate area of each county that is inside 50-mile-buffer, save to column
calculate perc of area of each county that is in 50-mile-buffer, save to column
copy us_counties_raw layer and join all new columns: area, clipped area and number of center
sexport copied layer to work in pandas
